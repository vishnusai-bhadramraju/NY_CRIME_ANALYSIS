# NYPD Crime Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes historical NYPD crime data to predict the seriousness of a crime. It utilizes Python, Anaconda, and Tableau for data analysis, visualization, and prediction.

### Description

This project delves into NYPD crime data, aiming to predict the likelihood of a reported crime being categorized as serious. By analyzing various crime factors, the project leverages machine learning for informed predictions.

### Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition:**
    - NYPD public crime data was acquired (source details to be included).
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    - Python scripts were used to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This included handling missing values, inconsistencies, and data formatting.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Tableau was used to visualize crime trends, patterns, and relationships between various factors (e.g., crime type, location, time of day).
4. **Feature Engineering:**
    - Python libraries were used to create additional features from existing data that might be relevant for prediction (e.g., combining location data for neighborhood analysis).
5. **Model Training and Selection:**
    - A Naive Bayes model was chosen and trained on the prepared data to predict crime seriousness.

### Results

- Tableau visualizations provided insights into crime patterns and potential factors influencing seriousness.
- The trained Naive Bayes model achieved an accuracy of 95% (replace with your actual accuracy) in predicting crime seriousness.

### Tools and Technologies

* Python
* Anaconda
* Tableau
* Scikit-learn (or specific Python libraries used for data manipulation and machine learning)

### Future Enhancements

* Explore other machine learning algorithms and compare their performance.
* Integrate real-time crime data feeds for more dynamic analysis.
* Develop a user interface for interactive data exploration and prediction.
